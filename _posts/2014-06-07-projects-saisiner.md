Webapp for track, share trips and help to find new places to visit all over the world for a real ultimate experience.

It is currently the first Beta, made to track a trip I made with friends around Europe.

It is a WIP but right now looking for free time to add tons of features to it.

Technologies: Ruby on Rails.
